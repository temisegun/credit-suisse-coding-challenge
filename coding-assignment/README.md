Credit Suisse coding assessment

This assessment took me 1hr 45mins approximately. I was not able to complete the assessment. I was not able to complete unit tests.

The example file from the assignment was used as a quick verification that the program works. 
When prompted from the program, the filePath used for verification is the following : './logFiles/exampleFile.txt'
